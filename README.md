# AtomicKotlinMaze

This project contains the game described in
the ['AtomicKotlin'](http://atomickotlin.com) book.

The 'Object-Oriented Programming' section explains the 
concepts of OOP using examples from this game.
It will be [published](https://www.atomickotlin.com/sample/) soon.

To start the game, run the `main` function in the `src/main/kotlin/ui/main.kt` file
or run the following gradle command:

```
./gradlew build
./gradlew game
```
